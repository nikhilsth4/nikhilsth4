# Hi there! 👋

I'm **Nikhil Shrestha**, a prospective PhD candidate in Computer Science passionate about **self-supervised multimodal AI** and **machine learning systems**. I recently completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at The University of Texas Permian Basin with a perfect 4.0 GPA. My research focuses on building AI systems that learn efficiently from unlabeled data while remaining interpretable, fair, and deployable in real-world applications.
